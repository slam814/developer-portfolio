        I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web designer I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and
        function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the “World Wide Web” was
        created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The requirements for this occupation vary with what kind of
        work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree. Though.... Many list a Bachelor of Science
        degree as the educational requirement. These are 4-year degrees, which mean they typically require 4 years of education beyond the
        completion of high school. Simple computer classes at this school could benefit in achieving this career but over all I don’t think
        they would help in becoming advanced in this occupation. Full Sail University has a Bachelor’s degree program in web design and
        development, this program isn’t the cheapest but its guaranteed to give a good education. The cost of this program from this school
        is about $80,000, but the students enrolled in this program study web design and development for Internet sites. (Top 10 Best Online

        The schedule of a web designer differs when it comes to if they work at home or not, people who work at home can just wake up and
        start when they please and end their work whenever they want so they can have some flexibility. But if you work in a company you
        would work much more, it’s not clear the exact schedule or everyday routine because that also differs depending on where you work
        and what field of web designing you’re in. there aren’t many health hazards in this occupation except for the obvious ones like
        pinched nerves from sitting all the time and carpal-tunnel from keyboards, but they can be prevented and aren’t really hazards.
